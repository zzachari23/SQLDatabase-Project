# SQLDatabase-Project

## About The Project
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in working with relational databases, such as MySQL, and programming languages like SQL and Python. Additionally, I aim to showcase my creative data visualization skills using tools like Tableau. The central focus of this project revolves around the Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset, sourced from https://data.cityofnewyork.us, comprising over 5 million data entries. To access this dataset, I utilized Python and the SODA API and trasnfered the extracted data to an organized tabular CSV file. Afterwards the data was transfered into a Microsoft Excel sheet for data cleaning and transformation. Within the project repository, you'll find a meticulously constructed MySQL database, created using MySQL Workbench, housing comprehensive information on collisions that occurred in 2016 within the states of Maryland, DC, and Virginia, chosen due to my proximity to them. In addition, the repository includes a text file containing sample SQL CRUD queries, an ERD diagram, and an accompanying report, all designed to elucidate the database's structure and purpose. To enhance the project's visual appeal and insights, I've crafted a Tableau dashboard, encapsulating the potential influencing factors behind these collisions.

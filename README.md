# SQLDatabase-Project

## About The Project
The overall purpose of the projct is to demonstrate my skills and knowledge with relational databases such as MySQL and programming languages such as SQL and Python. I wanted to also demontrate my skills and creativity with data visualization with data visualization tools like Tableau. The project revolves around the Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset that contains details on crash events. The dataset comes from https://data.cityofnewyork.us and the dataset contains over 5 million data entries. I was able to extract the data using Python via the SODA API into a CSV file. I then trasfered the CSV file into a Microsoft Excel sheet and used excel to clean and transform the data. The project repistory contains a MySQL database that I have built using MySQL workbench that contains various data on crashes that have occured in the year 2016 around the states of Maryland, DC, and Virgina. I chose these states specifically since I reside near them. The repo also contains a txt file that shows sample SQL CRUD queries to demonstrate to users how they can retrieve informaiton out of the database. A ERD diagram and report is also inlcuded to help further understand how the database is built and connected and understand it's ovreall purpose. Lastly, a source file to the Tableau dashboard I have created is also included to help illustrate to users visually how certain factors may have influced the crashes.
